# Rotationbarber
The main objective was to develop a web application that would allow customers to book services, check prices and manage their appointments, while barbers and administrators could manage appointments, unavailability and finances. 
The application was developed using technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL, with integration of external libraries such as Swiper, Stripe, PayPal and intl-tel-input. Three dashboards were created: each with specific functionalities, for customers, barbers and administrators.
